# Updates June 2

I'm pivoting slightly. I realized that my only ground truth is the control directions - these are the casual ground truth for the reader. 

I've cleaned up the existing repeng code, and reverted many of my changes (extract, control)
- reader & extract2 are old experiments (couple of days old) that I'm keeping since I think they'll be useful

I deleted honesty 1-3, as they were all focused on replicating that graph from the original paper (which I'm not sure does anything tbh..)

- I'll be using new_reader.py as my main reader file
- reader_viewer has latscan + sentence viewer
- new_reader.ipynb  as my main notebook



# Forked from https://github.com/vgel/repeng/

I want to add rep reading from the original paper, or at least show the graphs. Why? 

AI alignment!!!
